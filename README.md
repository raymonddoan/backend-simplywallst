# Backend API Solution - Simply Wall St Coding Challenge

## Created by Raymond Doan, *aspiring* Junior Front-end Developer at Simply Wall St

## Overview

This is a back-end REST API solution built on NodeJS and Express to provide information on company data including share prices and snowflake score.

## Instructions

To install and use the web application:

1. Clone the app using terminal: `git clone git@github.com:raymonddoan/backend-simplywallst.git`.
2. Once the app has been cloned, change into the app's directory using: `cd backend-simplywallst`.
3. Install the dependencies required to run the app using: `yarn install`.
4. Once the dependencies have been installed, you can now start the app using: `yarn start`.

## Tech Stack

Backend API server was built on:

- `express` as the back-end framework,
- `nodemon` for monitoring the development of the API,
- `knex` for connecting to the SQLite database, and;
- `cors` for providing a Express middleware.

## Challenge Notes

I have not fully completed the assignment, as I was already well over the 6-8 hour time limit. With more time, I would have liked to add security using an API key.
